             <p><Strong>Challenger</Strong> has been operating in Singapore for 34 years and has been well establised as a IT retailer. It has many valueClub member in Singapore, a membership that offers consumers
             with discounted price and enjoy certain privileges. Over the course of 34 years, Challenger has rapidly expanded to about 34 shops country wide. In Singapore, it has been recognized as a market leader in
             the IT retail environment.</p>
             <p><Strong>Purpose of its website</Strong> As a market leader in IT retail environment, there is no surprise that Challenger has adopted web development technology and it uses the website as a means of
                 providing users with events updates and promotions. The website allows users to create their account so as to track their membership rewards and privileges. Essentially, the website provides user with
                 self-help knowledge where they can find useful information to address their problems or enquiries without the need to call the hotlines
                 or making a trip to the nearest branch. Otherwise, like most standard service industry websites, the website serves to provide user with each outlet details such as the address and the operating hours.

         <div class="content textjustify col-xs-12 col-md-5">
             <p><Strong>Target Audience</Strong> Challenger's website intended audiences are mainly the consumers of IT electronic items and especially those who already has its membership. The people tend to
             access this website are those that wanted to find out any latest promotions or events like fair to attend. Also, people who wanted to find out the nearest branch from their locations could also use this
             website to gain information. In order to reduce the number of customers seeking for help, the website has been built to serve this purpose.</p>
             <p><Strong>Accuracy</Strong> The contents of the website are mostly well updated to the latest information. There are no signs of any events or promotions that has been expired or too advance. All the outlets information
             are up to date and accurate. However, there is a misleading indication on the brand catalogue where it stated "New", while the date published is on November 2015. Although, it is the latest brand catalogue,
             it should not in anyway be considered New as the period between November 2015 and the present date is never close.

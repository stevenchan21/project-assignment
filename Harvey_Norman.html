                <p>The website has excellent navigation espcially when it comes to searching for a product. It has a search engine built into the website, the categorized items from the Browse Products
                dropdown are clear and easy to look for items. In addition, it allows the user to filter by brands, product type and cost budget. There is also a sort by items from the Newest to the oldest</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="visual">
                <p>The visual appeal of the website is pretty dull perhaps due to the corporate color. The idea of the carousel does catch the user's attention, with the promotion
                display spinning off in style. Unfortunately that is as much as it gets, the website in perception looks simple and nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, there is limited images on display to
                bring life to the website. The website may have updated contents but the outlook gives the user that the website is on the verge of being abandon soon with the plain outlook.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="layout">
                <p>The placement of the elements and positioning are great. The whole website looks very clean and well organized. From the header to body and to footer, everything is well aligned. Even the contents within
                each section of the page are well organized. The website is very consistent, with the login section, the header and the footer having the same standard across all its pages.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="readability">
                <p>Most of the contents have a font size too small and may strain the eyes of some elderly users. The font size used in most of the content is 12 pixels with font style of Helvetica Neue. This sizing may seems
                seems approriate for standard documents in microsoft words but the font size used may not be a good match with the font style which in turn makes the wording looks smaller than usual standard.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="loading">
                <p>The loading speed of most of the pages are quite fast and lives well within most users' expections. As mentioned above the average standard of a human tolerance of loading a page is about
                3 or 4 seconds these days and the site has a good record of getting loaded within 2 seconds. There is only a few pages like the one under "Top Partners" going into "Valore", which takes about 4 seconds
                to load, still it is considered within the expectation of a normal user.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="color">
                <p>The website takes credit from the consistent use of corporate colors. However, these colors has inevitably made the website looks dull. The additional colors used for example, the event calendar
                are too contrast with the corporate colors and may seems incompatible. Under promotions, the colors used to display for each item's promotion is outstanding and definitely catches the user's eyes, however,
                it does not go well with the whole website corporate colors. The grey color used on the wordings for most contents is a good idea. Most importantly, it does not hurt the eye of the user with its
                dim color and it certainly matches up with the two corporate colors namely, navy blue and orange.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane margin-top fade" id="improvement">
                <p>In order to beef up the contents, Challenger could consider taking this website further and tranforming it into a ecommerce operation. In this case, there will be more contents and images to load into the website
                and this helps to decorate the website from its simplicity outlook. The font size should definitely increase slightly to give a better visualization for the user to read, or perhaps it could consider
                changing the font style. While the main colors used in the website is most appropriate, adding new colors to the website can be quite difficult to suggest as the colors that are compatible to the
                corporate colours are limited. Perhaps a lighter blue or black color could match up with the corporate colours.</p>
